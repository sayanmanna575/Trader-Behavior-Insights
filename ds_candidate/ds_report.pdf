## Project Overview
This analysis examines the relationship between trader behavior on Hyperliquid and Bitcoin market sentiment using two datasets:
1. **Bitcoin Market Sentiment Dataset** (Fear & Greed Index)
2. **Hyperliquid Trader Data** (transaction records)

## Key Findings

### Counterintuitive Trading Patterns
Our analysis reveals that trader behavior is counterintuitive compared to traditional market wisdom:

1. **Highest Activity During Fear**
   - Trading volume peaks during extreme fear ($8.2M daily avg)
   - Lowest activity occurs during extreme greed ($1.1M daily avg)
   - Trade frequency follows the same pattern

2. **Profitability Insights**
   - Highest average daily profits during extreme fear ($52,793)
   - Highest win rates during extreme greed (87.72%)
   - Best risk-adjusted returns during extreme greed (0.021037)

3. **Statistical Correlations**
   - Sentiment vs Trading Volume: -0.274
   - Sentiment vs Trade Count: -0.247
   - Sentiment vs Profitability: -0.096

## Strategic Implications
